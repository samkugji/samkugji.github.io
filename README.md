## Docs

### Running locally

To test locally, run the following in your terminal:

1. Clone repo locally
2. run `jekyll serve`
3. Open your browser to `localhost:4000`

### Customizing

First you'll want to fork the repo to your own account. Then clone it locally and customize, or use the GitHub web editor to customize.

* Most of the basic customization will take place in the `/_config.yml` file.
* Most of the content configuration will take place in the `/_layouts/resume.html` file. 

### Publishing to GitHub Pages for free

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) will host this for free with your GitHub account.
To setup your GH Pages site with a custom domain, [follow the instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/) on the GitHub Help site for that topic.
